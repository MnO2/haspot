In this video Stuart Jay Raj briefed about the relationship between 한글 and sanskrit. Basically when king 조선 세종 created the han-gul. They learned it from Mangolia’s Phags-pa, which could be dated back to sanskrit. Therefore, looking at the picture you could see common patterns between the two of writing alphabets. Inspiring watch!
