After listening to the [Lucien C.H. Lin](http://lucien.cc/about-2/)'s talk at [Coscup 2019](https://coscup.org/2019/) about his experience on working with corporates dealing with FLOSS communities and licenses, I learn more about the practice in the industry. It also makes me to think about the license I would be using for my open source projects. [This](http://neilmitchell.blogspot.com/2018/08/licensing-my-haskell-packages.html) article from Neil Mitchell in Haskell community explained his stance very well, and by carefully reading his article I would tend to agree with his intent. I would be inclined to change all of my projects to be Apache-2.0 and BSD-3 dual license so that it has patent grant protection and at the same time compatible with GPL. Rust is using Apache-2.0 and MIT dual license but to my personal I like the clause in BSD-3 where it requires you can't use my name to endorse things you build, that makes sense to me. I would relicense my projects one by one from now on.
