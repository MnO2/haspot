Since the last article talking about the IPA, it is time to target a specific language. Wikipedia is a good resource of phonology chart, like you could find IPA for Korean and Korean Phonology article, which would give you a brief of what this language’s phonetic structure is. Once you could pronounce then you would gradually learn it.

Another thing is typing alphabet out on the computer. Korean has different keyboard kayout. Like the traditional Set-2 and Set-3 layout. They are drafted when the PC was getting more wide spread. Basically they are different ways of mapping Han-gul charaters onto the keyboard buttons. If you are going to adopt them, you have to memorize the keyboard layout without pegging into any of your previous experience. I would suggest to use another keyboard layout: HNC Romaja, Which puts the Han-gul into corresponding roman alphabet button, so when you hit ‘a’, it shows ‘ㅏ’. Much like you would type hiragana in Japanese.

You could set the keyboard layout in Mac’s Settings -> Keyboard -> Input Method -> Korean -> HNC Romaja

Here is a few examples with han-gul and its typing sequence.

```
안 녕 하 세 요 xan niex ha sei xyo
안 녕 히 계 세 요 xan niex hi gyei sei xyo
감 사 합 니 다 gam sa ham ni da
```

And internet slang

```
ㅋ ㅋ ㅋ k k k
```
