### Rakudo
I noticed the news where Larry Wall have a talk about Perl 6 speaking that it is going to be ready for production use before next Christmas. Well, maybe it’s time to have a dip of Perl 6, after such a long time of sixteen years development.

### Building Rakudo on Mac OS X
There does exist Homebrew formula for Rakudo, however, it is bit of outdated as the time of writing. I decided to fetch the latest source from the official site. It turned out it is not hard to get ie built on OS X.

```
wget “http://rakudo.org/downloads/star/rakudo-star-2014.12.1.tar.gz”

tar zxvf rakudo-star-2014.12.1.tar.gz
cd rakudo-star-2014.12.1/
perl Configure.pl --gen-parrot --gen-moar --gen-nqp --backends=parrot,jvm,moar
make
make install
```

### Speed
I am aware that rakudo comes with different backends, but it is just MoarVM that is going to be marked with green light. To have an idea about its speed, I wrote memoize version of Fibonacci number in rakudo and ruby 2.1.2 respectively. The programs are as follows:

```
my @memoize;

sub fib(Int $n) {
    if $n == 0 || $n == 1 {
        return 1;
    } else {
        if defined @memoize[$n] {
            return @memoize[$n];
        } else {
            @memoize[$n] = fib($n - 1) + fib($n - 2);
            return @memoize[$n];
        }
    }
}

say fib(1000);
$memoize = Array.new(100002)

def fib(n)
  if n == 0 or n == 1
    return 1
  else
    if $memoize[n] != nil
      return $memoize[n]
    else 
      $memoize[n] = fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)
      return $memoize[n]
    end
  end
end


puts fib(1000)
```

An simplest time command shows that rakudo is far more slower than ruby. In my opinion ruby implementation has been slow, but rakudo is even slower. For this level of speed I would keep it on my hobby language watching list for another while.
