On Nov. 25., [Dr. Chuan-Kai Lin](https://sites.google.com/site/chklin/home) gave an introduction [talk about functional programming](http://w.csie.org/app/news.php?Sn=3843) at National Taiwan University. 
Under the permission of Dr. Chuan-Kai Lin, and the department of CSIE, 
I provide the talk records here.
The original format is 3gp, but I encode it to MP3 and FLAC respectively.

* [MP3](https://www.asuswebstorage.com/navigate/s?u=innLp_)

The talk was given in Chinese.
