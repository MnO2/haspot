# Haspot: A Hakyll blog generator with Casper theme as default

Haspot is a static site generator based on Hakyll, and it ported Ghostâ€™s beautiful [Casper](https://github.com/TryGhost/Casper) theme. Once you install it, it is good to go.


## Installation

First you have to install all of the dependencies. Most important one is hakyll. The most easiest way as the time of Feb 2016 is using `stack`. Make sure you have `stack` installed on your computer.

``` bash
stack build
```

## Build and Launch page

``` bash
stack exec haspot watch
```
